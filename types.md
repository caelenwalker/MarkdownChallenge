## Types of AI
AI can be divided into two categories: weak and strong. Weak Artifical Intelligence describes a system's ability to execute a particular job. For example, video games, and Apple's Siri. Strong Artifical Intelligence describes a system's ability to carry out human-like jobs. For example, self-driving cars or hospital assistants. 

## AI Subsets
There are a couple different subsets of Artifical Intelligence. For example, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Machine Learning describes a computer programs' ability to automatically learn and adapt. Deep Learning describes automatic learning through a computer processing mass ammounts of data -- for example, text, documents, or images.
